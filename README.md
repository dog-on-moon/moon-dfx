moon-dfx is a library of dynamic AudioEffect nodes for Godot 4.4.
When added to the scene tree, they automatically create an AudioEffect for an associated bus, and deallocate it upon exiting the tree.

## Features

- Dynamic, run-time configuration of AudioEffects
- Easy way to define audio spaces on a scene-by-scene basis
- 2D and 3D DFX nodes, which mix audio effects depending on visual distance to target or camera
